▌We have been attempting to use Oauth for Asana and Klaviyo. The purpose is to
▌allow usersr to authenticate through those services and then access them for
▌creating tasks and updating existing tasks in Asana and pulling connected
▌client data from Klaviyo and retrieving the API keys that today we enter
▌manually. The manual version of adding API KEys for Klavyio will still be an
▌option but adding the OAuth ability will improve user experience. Review the
▌current implementation of Oauth for Asana and Klaviyo in it's current iteration
▌in the /clients URL, devise a plan to fix and implementa and proceed.
