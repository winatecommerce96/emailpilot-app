### Generated Variants:

#### Variant 1: Problem-Solution Framework
```
Subject: We noticed you've been away, {{first_name}}
Preview: Life gets busy. We get it. Here's something to welcome you back...
Headline: Welcome Back – We've Missed You

Body Copy:
{{first_name}},

We noticed it's been a while since your last visit. Life gets busy – we totally understand.

But we didn't want you to miss out on what's been happening. We've added some amazing new pieces that we think you'll love, and we want to welcome you back with something special.

For the next 7 days, enjoy 25% off your return order, plus free shipping. No minimum purchase required.

Consider it our way of saying "we're glad you're back."

CTA: Welcome Me Back

Rationale: Problem-Solution acknowledges the lapse without being pushy. Positions the offer as a welcome-back gift rather than desperation.
```

#### Variant 3: FOMO Framework
```
Subject: Last chance before these sell out, {{first_name}}
Preview: Your favorites from {{last_category}} are flying off the shelves...
Headline: Don't Let These Slip Away

Body Copy:
{{first_name}},

Remember those {{last_category}} items you loved? They're selling faster than we expected.

We saved a few pieces in your size, but honestly, we can't hold them much longer. Our best sellers from this season are already showing "low stock" warnings.

Here's the thing – we'd rather see you wearing them than anyone else.

Use code COMEBACK25 for 25% off your return order, and snag these pieces before they're gone for good.

Stock is updated in real-time, so what you see is what's left.

CTA: Shop Before It's Gone

Rationale: FOMO framework creates urgency around specific products. References past browsing behavior to make scarcity feel personal and relevant.
