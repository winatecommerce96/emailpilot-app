### Example

```
python
from langgraph_checkpoint_firestore import FirestoreSaver
```

# Initialize the saver
Collections - write and checkpoint -  are created if it does not exists
```
#memory = FirestoreSaver(project_id=<project_id>, checkpoints_collection='langchain', writes_collection='langchain_writes')
```
```
with FirestoreSaver.from_conn_info(project_id=<project_id>, checkpoints_collection='langchain', writes_collection='langchain_writes') as memory:
```

## Limitations
List function does not support filters. You can only pass config on thread id to get the list.

```
print(list(memory.list(config=config)))
```
